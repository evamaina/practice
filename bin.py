""" In order to print a number in its binary representation,
 you can use the bin() function. bin() takes an integer as
 input and returns the binary representation of that integer in a string.
  (Keep in mind that after using the bin function, you can no longer
  operate on the value like a number.)You can also represent numbers
  in base 8 and base 16 using the oct() and hex() functions."""
